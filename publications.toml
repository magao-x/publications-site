MagAO-X is an entirely new extreme adaptive optics system for the Magellan
Clay 6.5 m telescope, funded by the NSF MRI program starting in Sep 2016.
The key science goal of MagAO-X is high-contrast imaging of accreting
protoplanets at Hα. With 2040 actuators operating at up to 3630 Hz, MagAO-X
will deliver high Strehls (> 70%), high resolution (19 mas), and high contrast
(< 1 × 10^-4 ) at Hα (656 nm). We present an overview of the MagAO-X system,
review the system design, and discuss the current project status.

The MagAO-X instrument is an upgrade of the Magellan AO system that will
introduce extreme adaptive optics capabilities for high-contrast imaging at
visible and near-infrared wavelengths. A central component of this system is a
2040-actuator microelectromechanical (MEMS) deformable mirror (DM) from Boston
Micromachines Corp. (BMC) that will operate at 3.63 kHz for high-order
wavefront control. Two additional DMs from ALPAO will perform low-order and
non-common-path science-arm wavefront correction. The accuracy of the wavefront
correction is limited by our ability to command these DMs to a desired shape,
which requires a careful characterization of each DM surface. We have developed
a characterization pipeline that uses a Zygo Verifire Interferometer to measure
the surface response and a Karhunen-Loeve transform to remove noise from our
measurements. We present our progress in the characterization process and the
results of our pipeline applied to an ALPAO DM97 and a BMC Kilo-DM,
demonstrating the ability to drive the DMs to a flat of ≤2nm and ≤4nm RMS in
our beam footprint on the University of Arizona Wavefront Control (UAWFC)
testbed.

The Magellan Extreme Adaptive Optics (MagAO-X) is a visible-wavelength adaptive
optics (AO) instrument optimized for visible light coronagraphy and exoplanet
imaging with the 6.5-m Magellan Clay telescope in Chile. Extremely large
telescopes such as the future Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) will be able to
image earth-like exoplanets, given an extreme AO system - such as MagAO-X -
exists. MagAO-X is now under development in the lab and undergoing final
integration and testing. Technical first light is planned for early 2019, with
final commissioning in late 2020. A crucial component to MagAO-X is the
“K-mirror,” a 3-mirror system designed to rotate the optical field with minimal
image wobble or distortion about the optical axis. The K-mirror rotates on a
miniature motorized stage to stabilize the pupil in the coronagraph as the
telescope tracks the sky. The optical design of MagAO-X required a very compact
K-mirror, resulting in a challenging opto-mechanical mount design. We present a
novel solution to the compact design of a 50mm max envelope K-mirror for
MagAO-X that consists of three < 1-in diameter flat mirrors, all precision
glued in place. The K-mirror mount was designed in Autodesk® Fusion 360™ and a
prototype was built in the Steward Observatory machine shop. Using inexpensive
COTS mirrors, the K-mirror prototype was tested, aligned, and glued with
optical feedback in the lab. Once the prototype had proven successful, a final
K-mirror mount was fabricated and assembled with invar and precision (0.1nm RMS
surface roughness, super polished, λ/40 PV flat) mirrors to develop a compact
K-mirror for MagAO-X. The performance of the final hardware is presented here.

The success of ground-based, high contrast imaging for the detection of
exoplanets in part depends on the ability to differentiate between quasi-static
speckles caused by aberrations not corrected by adaptive optics (AO) systems,
known as non-common path aberrations (NCPAs), and the planet intensity signal.
Frazin (ApJ, 2013) introduced a post-processing algorithm demonstrating that
simultaneous millisecond exposures in the science camera and wavefront sensor
(WFS) can be used with a statistical inference procedure to determine both the
series expanded NCPA coefficients and the planetary signal. We demonstrate, via
simulation, that using this algorithm in a closed-loop AO system, real-time
estimation and correction of the quasi-static NCPA is possible without separate
deformable mirror (DM) probes. Thus the use of this technique allows for the
removal of the quasi-static speckles that can be mistaken for planetary signals
without the need for new optical hardware, improving the efficiency of
ground-based exoplanet detection. In our simulations, we explore the behavior
of the Frazin Algorithm (FA) and the dependence of its convergence to an
accurate estimate on factors such as Strehl ratio, NCPA strength, and number of
algorithm search basis functions. We then apply this knowledge to simulate
running the algorithm in real-time in a nearly ideal setting. We then discuss
adaptations that can be made to the algorithm to improve its real-time
performance, and show their efficacy in simulation. A final simulation tests
the technique’s resilience against imperfect knowledge of the AO residual phase,
motivating an analysis of the feasibility of using this technique in a real
closed-loop Extreme AO system such as SCExAO or MagAO-X, in terms of
computational complexity and the accuracy of the estimated quasi-static NCPA
correction.

Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization Complex Mask Coronagraphs (PIAACMC) offer
high-contrast performance at a small inner-working angle (< 1 λ/D) with high
planet throughput (> 70%). The complex mask is a multi-zone, phase-shifting
mask comprised of tiled hexagons which vary in depth. Complex masks can be
difficult to fabricate as there are many micron-scale hexagonal zones (> 500 on
average) with continuous depths ranging over a few microns. Ensuring the
broadband PIAACMC design performance carries through to fabricated devices
requires that these complex masks are manufactured to within well-defined
tolerances. We report on a simulated tolerance analysis of a "toy" PIAACMC
design which characterizes the effect of common microfabrication errors on
on-axis contrast performance using a simple Monte Carlo method. Moreover, the
tolerance analysis provides crucial information for choosing a fabrication
process which yields working devices while potentially reducing process
complexity. The common fabrication errors investigated are zone depth
discretization, zone depth errors, and edge artifacts between zones.

One of the main pursuits of the MagAO-X project is imaging planets around
nearby stars with the direct detection method utilizing an extreme AO system
and a coronagraph and a large telescope. The MagAO-X astronomical coronagraph
will be implemented on the 6.5 meter Clay Magellan Telescope in Chile. The 22
mirrors in the system require a high level of mirror stability. Our goal is
less than 1 microradian drift in tilt per mirror per one degree Celsius change
in temperature. There are no commercial 2inch kinematic optical mounts that are
truly “zero-drift” from 0-20C. Our solution to this problem was to develop a
locking clamp to keep our optics stable and fulfill our specifications. After
performing temperature variation and thermal shock testing, we conclude that
this novel locking clamp significantly increases the thermal stability of
stainless steel mounts by ~10x but still allows accurate microradian
positioning of a mirror. A provisional patent (#62/632,544) has been obtained
for this mount.

Here we review the current optical mechanical design of MagAO-X. The project is
post-PDR and has finished the design phase. The design presented here is the
baseline to which all the optics and mechanics have been fabricated. The
optical/mechanical performance of this novel extreme AO design will be
presented here for the first time. Some highlights of the design are: 1) a
floating, but height stabilized, optical table; 2) a Woofer tweeter (2040
actuator BMC MEMS DM) design where the Woofer can be the current f/16 MagAO ASM
or, more likely, fed by the facility f/11 static secondary to an ALPAO DM97
woofer; 3) 22 very compact optical mounts that have a novel locking clamp for
additional thermal and vibrational stability; 4) A series of four pairs of
super-polished off-axis parabolic (OAP) mirrors with a relatively wide FOV by
matched OAP clocking; 5) an advanced very broadband (0.5-1.7μm) ADC design; 6)
A Pyramid (PWFS), and post-coronagraphic LOWFS NCP wavefront sensor; 7) a vAPP
coronagraph for starlight suppression. Currently all the OAPs have just been
delivered, and all the rest of the optics are in the lab. Most of the major
mechanical parts are in the lab or instrument, and alignment of the optics has
occurred for some of the optics (like the PWFS) and most of the mounts. First
light should be in early 2019.

The challenges of high contrast imaging (HCI) for detecting exoplanets for both

for ground- based telescopes and space-based missions, and examine them using
the angular spectrum Fresnel propagation module within the Physical Optics
Propagation in Python (POPPY) package. We present an end-to-end (E2E)
simulation of the MagAO-X instrument, an ExAO system capable of delivering 6x10
-5 visible-light raw contrast for static, noncommon path aberrations without
atmosphere. We present an E2E simulation of a laser guidestar (LGS) companion
spacecraft testbed demonstration, which uses a remote beacon to increase the
signal available for WFS and control of the primary aperture segments of a
future large space telescope, providing of order 10 factor improvement for
relaxing observatory stability requirements.

The Magellan extreme adaptive optics (MagAO-X) instrument is a new extreme
adaptive optics (ExAO) system designed for operation in the visible to near-IR
which will deliver high contrast-imaging capabilities. The main AO system will
be driven by a pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS); however, to mitigate the
impact of quasi-static and non-common path (NCP) aberrations, focal plane
wavefront sensing (FPWFS) in the form of low-order wavefront sensing (LOWFS)
and spatial linear dark field control (LDFC) will be employed behind a vector
apodizing phase plate (vAPP) coronagraph using rejected starlight at an
intermediate focal plane. These techniques will allow for continuous
high-contrast imaging performance at the raw contrast level delivered by the
vAPP coronagraph ( 6 x 10-5). We present simulation results for LOWFS and
spatial LDFC with a vAPP coronagraph, as well as laboratory results for both
algorithms implemented with a vAPP coronagraph at the University of Arizona
Extreme Wavefront Control Lab.

Despite promising astrometric signals, to date there has been no success in

Clio instrument and MagAO adaptive optics system on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m

apodizing phase plate (vAPP) coronagraph in a narrowband filter at 3.9 microns.
The vAPP coronagraph and MagAO allow us to be sensitive to planets much less
massive than the limits set by previous non-detections. However, analysis of
these data presents challenges due to the target’s brightness and unique
characteristics of the instrument. We present a comparison of dimensionality
reduction techniques to construct background illumination maps for the whole
detector using the areas of the detector that are not dominated by starlight.
Additionally, we describe a procedure for sub-pixel alignment of vAPP data
using a physical-optics-based model of the coronagraphic PSF.
